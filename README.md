# mecab_for_flutter

Since 2.0.0 of [the dart package](https://github.com/CaptainDario/mecab_for_dart), this package is not needed anymore as the binaries are bundled using native assets.
It is only used for [the example](./example) and hosting a [mecab web app](https://captaindario.github.io/mecab_for_flutter/).
